# Нейронные сети в PyTorch

With LiaScript, we tried to implement an extended
[Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) format that should enable
everyone to create, share, adapt, translate or correct online courses without
the need of being a web-developer. We believe that a language-based approach,
instead of a tooling-centered one, provides more flexibility, freedom of
creativity, and sustainability. Therefor we tried to develop a simplistic syntax
that extends the static Markdown with quizzes, animations, spoken text,
automated visualization [ASCII-art](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII_art) and
much more. Everything has been woven around Markdown, so that the content can
still be read and interpreted with any kind of editor or Markdown-interpreter.


**What is LiaScript?**

* a Markdown dialect for interactive courses and data-driven publishing,
* everything is implemented in Elm/JavaScript and runs directly within the
  browser (online),
* the interpreter itself is also a reader, which allows for storing documents as
  well as the progress,
* courses can also be taken offline, since the interpreter is also a progressive
  web app (PWA), that allows to store documents and progress directly within
  the browser (locally),
* everything is private, we do not store any data about the courses nor the
  users and their progress

There are a couple of problems that we currently see in the creation of
[Open educational resources (OER)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_educational_resources).
One of them is isolation, that means people, who want to create content, are
seldomly connected via the applied technologies, instead, they are separated by
platforms, authoring tools and used core technologies (programming languages).
Furthermore, it is not possible to simply grab an educational website/project
and to adapt its content for another audience. Additionally, it seems to be
nearly impossible for people without a technical background to simply set up a
small course. Thus, they stuck with Word, PowerPoint, and PDF, since they
provide a simple continuation of the static formats people have used before the
computer-era.
"_If I want to publish content for the computer, I want my audience to dive in, experiment, simulate, play with the content... but not only read._"

********************************************************************************

**Goals**

* Simplicity: with a human-centered markup-language, anyone should be enabled to
  create and modify content.
* Interactive: the browser is the next operating systems and although content
  with LiaScript is developed within a "static" markup-language it should not be
  presented that way.
* Extendability: everything that is not part of LiaScript shall be embeddable
  and importable.
* Durability: platforms go down, the development of proprietary software/formats
  is discontinued, but LiaScript is not hosted on one platform (it can be
  hosted everywhere) and even without the LiaScript interpreter the content is
  still readable and interpretable with every editor; you could even print or
  engrave it on stone or clay. Furthermore, if you use some kind of versioning
  system (e.g. [git](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git)) you can refer to any
  previous version of your course.

Imagine a world where everyone would have the same access to high quality
educational content for free. Imagine all kind of schoolbooks, technical or
scientific literature could become open-courSe projects and more interactive,
with collaborating teachers and students. Everything that is required is a
simple text-editor and a web-browser.

Поскольку не все шрифты доступны на всех компьютерах (существуют тысячи шрифтов и большинство из них не бесплатны), CSS предусматривает резервную систему. Первым вы указываете шрифт, который хотели бы использовать. Затем следуют любые шрифты, которые вы могли бы использовать, если первый указанный шрифт не доступен. А закончить список вы должны типовым шрифтом, который имеет 5 видов: serif, sans-serif, monospace, cursive и fantasy.

As already mentioned all you need to work with LiaScript is an text-editor, but
it can be usefull to apply one of the following tools. At least we apply them to
see the result of a change within the course document immediately. You will see,
that the development of online-courses will speed up, especially if there is no
need for memorizing complex point and click sequences.
